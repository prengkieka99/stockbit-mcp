/**
 * Reaping browser processes that hold the saved profile.
 *
 * Field report, 2026-08-31: eleven orphaned browser processes accumulated against
 * `user-data-dir=~/.stockbit/browser-profile` and blocked every later login with
 * "exited immediately without opening a debugging port". Clearing it took a manual `pkill` plus
 * removing a stale `SingletonLock`. Nothing in the server reaped them, because the spawn is not
 * detached and the MCP login is fire-and-forget, so the cleanup attached to the capture promise
 * never ran when that promise was abandoned.
 *
 * The process lister and the killer are injected throughout. CI runs three operating systems with
 * NO browser installed, so a test that needed a real Chromium to exercise this would be a test that
 * never runs on the machines that gate a merge — the blind spot `store.ts` records as having already
 * produced two invisible mistakes.
