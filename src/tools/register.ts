 * that a label was a number.
 *
 * A `Map`, not an object literal: `ANNOTATION_REQUIRES["constructor"]` on an object reads through
 * `Object.prototype` and answers with a FUNCTION, so the `??` fallback beside it never fires and

/**
 * One annotation coordinate. Anything empty means ABSENT, not zero.
 *
 * `z.coerce.number()` is `Number()`, and `Number()` answers **0** for a whole family of values that
 * carry no number at all: `null`, `""`, `"  "`, `false`, `[]`. So a caller that sent `price: null`
 * ("I have no price for this one") had a coordinate invented for it at the price 0, and nothing
 * downstream could tell that apart from a real zero — the annotation was counted in
 * `annotationsDrawn`, and the 0 then dragged the price scale to the axis origin, squashing forty
 * sessions of a 4,000-level chart into three pixels of the 340px price panel while the summary
 * reported it drawn and `annotationsNotDrawn: []`. Absence has to survive the schema, because past
 * it the handler has only a number.
 *
 * So the test is what the value IS, not which empties were thought of: a number passes as itself,
 * a string passes only if it has non-space content, and everything else is absent. Enumerating
 * `null` and `""` was the first attempt and it missed `"  "` — `Number("  ")` is 0 too, and
 * `"  " === ""` is false, which put the whole defect back through a different empty value.
 *
 * An EXPLICIT `0` is untouched and still widens the scale: a caller asking for a level at zero is
 * asking for that, and refusing it would be this server inventing policy instead of a number.
 * `"abc"` still fails validation rather than passing as absent — it is a value, just not a number,
 * and silently dropping it would hide a caller's typo.
 *
 * A factory rather than one shared instance: `zodToJsonSchema` emits the second USE of a shared
 * schema as `{"$ref": "#/properties/price"}`, so reusing one object would change the JSON Schema
 * every client reads. A fresh instance per field keeps that published shape byte-identical to what
 * a plain `z.coerce.number().optional()` produced.
