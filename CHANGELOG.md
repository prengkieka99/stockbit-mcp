# Changelog

Notable changes to `stockbit-mcp`. Entries record *why* as well as *what*, because most of the
hazards here are undocumented API behaviours that are expensive to rediscover.

The format is loosely [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Where an entry says a mapping
was **Observed**, it was read off a live response with a real account rather than inferred from a
name; see [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the rest of the evidence ladder.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-09-03

### Security

- **Cleared five Dependabot alerts by refreshing the lockfile.** `fast-uri` 3.1.5 → 3.1.7 and
  `qs` 6.15.3 → 6.16.0, closing four High advisories — host confusion via percent-encoded scheme
  normalization (`GHSA-jqff-g426-hqxp`), host confusion via skipped IDN canonicalization
  (`GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8`), SSRF via malformed IPv6 normalization (`GHSA-f65p-4m7j-42xc`), SSRF via
  repeated hostname percent-decoding (`GHSA-fph4-wmhf-6fwf`) — and one Moderate, the `qs`
  array-limit bypass via bracket-key comma parsing (`GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx`).

  Neither package is a declared dependency: `fast-uri` arrives under `ajv` and `qs` under `express`
  and `body-parser`, both by way of the MCP SDK. Both fixed versions already sat inside the ranges
  those parents declare, so this was a lockfile refresh rather than an upgrade — `package.json` is
  unchanged and no API surface moved.

  **None of the five was reachable here**, and that was measured rather than assumed: an ESM resolve
  hook recorded every package the server loads across `initialize`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`
  with all tools registered, and the answer was `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `ajv`, `ajv-formats`,
  `zod`, `zod-to-json-schema`. `fast-uri` never loads even though `ajv` does — `ajv` only reaches
  for it to resolve `$ref` URIs, and these schemas have none — and `qs`, `express` and
  `body-parser` never load at all, because this is a stdio server and the SDK's HTTP transport is
  dead code. Fixed anyway, because that argument expires the moment anyone runs the HTTP transport.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-02

### Added

- **`broker_activity` can choose its window.** Pass `period` for a preset or `from`+`to` for an
  exact range. The earlier finding that this endpoint answers 400 to `period` was correct and is
  unchanged — the name is still never sent — but it stopped one probe short: `from`/`to` **bind**.
  `from=2026-08-17&to=2026-08-21` echoed those exact dates back in `data.from`/`data.to` and
  returned 1034 buy rows against the default day's 868. A preset is resolved into a date pair here
  and the dates go on the wire.

  The arithmetic is not invented. `broker_summary` resolves the same names server-side and echoes
  the result, and it answered `LAST_7_DAYS` → 2026-08-26..2026-09-01 and `LAST_3_MONTHS` →
  2026-06-01..2026-09-01 — the same dates this produces. `YEAR_TO_DATE` is the one difference: it
  starts on the first *trading* day (2026-01-02) where this starts on January 1st. That cannot move
  a figure, which was measured rather than argued — a Saturday start and the following Monday
  returned byte-identical rows.

- **`corporate_actions` accepts the calendar's spellings.** `tender` and `stock_reverse`, the two
  bucket keys `calendar_today` tags rows with that are not in the path vocabulary, are now
  translated to `tenderoffer` and `reversesplit`. The mapping was deliberately withheld until it
  stopped being a guess: `/corpaction/tenderoffer` returns its rows under a container named
  `tender`, and `/corpaction/reversesplit` under one named `stock_reverse` — the service equating
  the two vocabularies itself.

- **`market_movers` ships in the default profile**, and `CORE_CAP` rises to 41. `top_movers` reads a
  nine-symbol hotlist, so a default surface that could rank nine stocks but not the market was
  missing the more useful of the two.

  This costs the property `core` was built for, and the docs now say so rather than promising the
  opposite: `core` was exactly Cursor's 40-tool ceiling, and at 41 a Cursor user is one over. Cursor
  drops the overflow **without saying which tool it dropped**, so anyone on that client should name
  a narrower list.

- **`docs/LIVENESS.md`** — one place stating how fresh each reading is, and that **nothing here
  answers "what just traded"**. The measurements already existed; what was missing was a conclusion,
  and without one three tool descriptions had drifted into disagreeing. `running_trade` sent readers
  to `broker_flow_intraday`, which serves the *previous* session until the ~18:00 WIB broker
  release; `top_stocks`, the one route measured to be live, said nothing about liveness at all.

### Fixed

- **Automatic login recovery cannot fire for the failure it was written for, and ADR-0011 now says
  so.** Measured 2026-09-01, on the third attempt and the first to stage all three preconditions at
  once — a dead stored credential, an aged-out browser access token so `ensureFresh` level three
  declines, and a live browser refresh token so the relogin gate passes.

  The quote came back 401 in 1.8 s with no browser. The reason is structural and one layer below
  where the previous two attempts looked: `attemptAutoRelogin` is called only from `forceRefresh`'s
  catch, and `forceRefresh` runs only on a 401 **response** to a request. `getJson` resolves the
  credential before the request, so a dead refresh token throws in `ensureFresh`, no request is
  made, no 401 response exists, and recovery is never reached.

  So it can fire only when the stored token still mints an access token the API then refuses —
  never in the ordinary revoked-session case. Recorded, not rewired: moving the hook changes the
  auth failure path and wants its own decision record. `scripts/probe-relogin.ts` is the harness
  that staged it, and the first thing in this repo able to reach that state at all.

- **`broker_activity` reported "traded nothing" for a broker that traded 1704 stock-sides.**
  `data.broker_activity_transaction` is an **object** holding `brokers_buy` and `brokers_sell`, not
  an array — so the container lookup, which tests `Array.isArray`, matched nothing and the tool
  returned `count: 0` with `rowsFrom: null` while 868 buy rows and 836 sell rows sat in the payload.
  Naming the container in `ROW_CONTAINERS` could not have fixed it, because the value is not an
  array.

  A shape-aware reader now runs ahead of the generic one, the way `bucketsOf` does on the day
  calendar, and tags every row with the side it came from. Both sides send **positive** figures, so
  `side` is the only thing carrying direction and is required on every row; summing `value` across
  sides gives turnover, not net flow.

  The fixture is why this survived a green suite — it made the container an array, agreeing with
  what the reader expected rather than with the wire. It is now the measured shape.

- **The day calendar runs the date-order check its siblings already ran.** `getCalendarDay`'s
  buckets carry the `rups` and `dividend` kinds `suspectDates` covers, so the one view that shows
  every kind at once was the one that never questioned their dates.

### Changed

- **`calendar_today` is now `observed`.** It stayed `projected` while only its no-argument form had
  been measured. `GET /corpaction?date=2026-08-28` has now answered with the same twelve buckets and
  that day's own rows, so both wire forms it sends are measured. The same call settled a question
  the code had recorded as unknown: `today` **echoes the date requested** rather than naming the
  server's current day, which makes comparing them a real detector for this family's habit of
  answering a different question convincingly.

- **`broker_activity` is now `observed`** — rows came back and every field it projects (`symbol`,
  `side`, `date`, `value`, `lot`, `avgPrice`, `freq`, `investorType`) was read out of a real row.

- **A Telegram bot token fixture is no longer a real-looking one.** `test/redact.test.ts` held the
  sample token from Telegram's own Bot API documentation, which is real-looking enough that a reader
  has to stop and work out whose it is. Its two sibling fixtures were already obviously synthetic;
  this one now is too. No coverage changes — the test needs a string matching the shape, not a
  plausible one.

### Added

- **`market_movers` reaches every view Stockbit's own Movers dialog shows.** `mover_type` is now
  sent, as a **closed** vocabulary of the eight members the server was seen to echo back on
  2026-09-01: `topGainer`, `topLoser`, `topValue`, `topVolume`, `topFrequency`, `netForeignBuy`,
  `netForeignSell`, `bigMoneyNetValue`.

  The echo is what makes those eight evidence rather than guesses, and a control is what makes the
  echo trustworthy: `MOVER_TYPE_DEFINITELY_NOT_REAL` answers 400, so this endpoint rejects members
  it does not know instead of silently serving its default. That is the failure mode which hid the
  `topGainer`/`topgainer` hotlist bug for months, and it is absent here. The result reports the
  **echo** as `view` — what the server says it served — never what was requested.

  The dialog's ninth tab, IEP/IEV, is deliberately **not** an enum member: ten spellings of it were
  refused. It is a field, `iepiev_detail`, carried on every row of every view, projected as `iepIev`
  and only meaningful during pre-opening. Shipping it as a member would have told callers the server
  accepts a value nobody has seen it accept.

  Rows come from `data.mover_list` with `readFrom` naming each wire key, `unmappedKeys` for what the
  projection does not recognise, and the raw row kept. `limit` is honoured and capped at 50 by the
  service; `page` is ignored; the payload's own `pagination` block reads all zeros on every call and
  is therefore **not** passed through, because a `has_next: false` that is always false is not an
  answer about whether more rows exist.

### Fixed

- **`calendar_today` reported "no corporate actions today" while the response carried 19 of them.**
  The reader took the first array-valued key, and the payload is buckets whose first bucket
  (`bonus`) is empty — so a day holding a dividend, eight economic events, a RUPS and nine warrants
  read as nothing, with the rows sitting unread in `meta`. Every bucket is now returned, tagged with
  its kind, and `date` comes from the response's own `today` instead of `null`.

- **`top_movers` is a nine-symbol hotlist, and now says so.** It returned the same nine symbols at
  `limit` 5, 25, 50 and 100 — the service ignores `limit` — so it was never a market-wide ranking.
  That also disposes of a reported sort bug: a contiguous descending run of nine changes is what a
  correct sort over nine symbols looks like. `market_movers` is the market-wide surface, and the two
  disagreeing is expected rather than evidence either is wrong.

- **`prices_batch` does not batch.** Comma-joining symbols returns an empty list and the repeated-key
  form is a hard 400 (`too many values for field "stock_code"`), so there is no encoding that
  batches — the route takes one `stock_code` and returns a price *series*. More than one symbol is
  now refused locally rather than sent to come back empty, because an empty list reads as a claim
  about the market when the truth is a claim about the request.

- **`price_market` could not be called at all**, and now says so instead of offering arguments. It
  answers 400 with **no** query parameters, which is what settles it: if sending nothing is also an
  error, no combination of arguments is the fix. It names `orderbook`'s `market_data[]`, which
  already returns the per-board split.

- **`chart_series`'s `raw: true` escape hatch read a different endpoint from the one it exists to
  diagnose.** It called `/charts/:symbol` while the projection reads `/charts/:symbol/daily`, and
  the two do not share a timeframe vocabulary — the first refuses `1w` outright and answers
  `{chart_points: []}` for everything else. So `1w` errored and `1m` came back empty, and a caller
  read that emptiness as "the drift is gone".

- **`broker_activity` sent a `period` the endpoint refuses.** Every member of the ten-value
  `TB_PERIOD_*` enum answers 400 here — including the one its sibling `broker_distribution` accepts
  — while omitting it returns rows. It is no longer sent, and `broker_activity_transaction` joins
  the row containers, so the tool stops reporting `count: 0` beside a `dataKeys` that names the
  container the rows were in.

- **`broker_top` put the biggest broker last.** Rows arrive sorted **ascending** by `total_value`
  and `limit` is ignored, so a tool documented as "which brokers moved the most" led with the
  smallest of 89. Now sorted descending client-side and said so.

- **Payloads carrying broker- or foreign-derived figures now say which session they are from.**
  Measured after the ~18:00 WIB broker release, `running_trade`, `broker_flow_intraday` and
  `market_movers` all roll forward to the current day, and `is_show_net_foreign` flips false to true
  across that release — so figures carrying yesterday's date beforehand are correct and unpublished,
  not stale. `price_bands` carries an explicitly **null** `dataAsOf` with a note, because the
  orderbook payload has no date and fetching one from another endpoint would attribute one route's
  date to another's numbers.

- **`orderbook` names its units.** Its `volume` is SHARES while `technicals`' `volumeLots` is LOTS,
  reconciling ×100 — in a payload that also labels its depth figures `lot` beside a `volume` in
  shares. Two units under similar names in one response is a silent-wrong-answer generator.

- **`stockbit-auth login` drove the shared browser profile without taking `login.lock`.** Gate 5 of
  automatic recovery is "`login.lock` must be free", so it read free for the whole time a CLI login
  was open — and an unattended recovery could launch a second browser onto the profile where
  someone was at that moment typing their password. The documented cost of that collision is eleven
  orphaned browser processes and a `SingletonLock` that blocked every later login.

  The lock is now released on **SIGINT and SIGTERM as well as `exit`**: node does not run `exit`
  listeners when a signal terminates the process, and this command hands a human fifteen minutes to
  type, so Ctrl-C is the ordinary way to cancel it. Releasing only on `exit` would have leaked the
  lock for twenty minutes on the commonest path — worse than never taking it.

- **A failed token refresh no longer reports a network outage as a dead credential.** `refreshOnce`
  labelled every non-ok refresh `kind: "auth"`, so a 502 was indistinguishable from a revoked
  session. It now routes through `kindForStatus`, which already encoded the rule, rather than a
  second copy of it.

### Changed

- **ADR-0011's status now claims exactly what has been observed.** The recovery path has never been
  run against a live Stockbit session, so end to end it is **Projected**; the gates, the latch and
  the redaction are verified offline and are stated as such. An attempt on 2026-09-01 found *why*
  nobody has seen it run: `ensureFresh` adopts the browser's own access token before any refresh, so
  a dead stored credential does not produce a 401 while the browser session is alive.

- **A dead market-data session can now repair itself once, unattended, behind a switch.** Every
  signal for a dead session already existed and not one of them acted: the health journal records
  refusals, `status` computes `main.health: "failing"` and `webSession.rejected`, and a 401 becomes a
  good error at the call site. All three are *reports*. What was missing was the action — the session
  died mid-task twice in one session and a person had to notice, read, and re-run the login by hand.

  On a failed refresh, `forceRefresh` now makes **one** attempt to harvest a credential out of the
  still-live browser session. Five gates, every one required, all default to off: the process must
  have called `armAutoRelogin()` (only `bin/stockbit-mcp.ts` does), `STOCKBIT_AUTO_RELOGIN` must be
  set, `STOCKBIT_NO_BROWSER` must not be, the website session must be *provably* alive
  (`likelyValid`, never `!expired` — those are not complements), and `login.lock` must be free.

  Arming is how "never inside `stockbit-batch`" is enforced. Batch reaches `forceRefresh` through the
  same client as everything else and there is no run-mode marker in this repo, so a condition in the
  auth layer would have to *infer* the entry point. A capability batch never grants itself cannot be
  got wrong by a later edit; a test pins the caller list to exactly one file.

  **The retry is the proof.** `forcedRefreshes` is still raised when recovery returns, which switches
  off the access cache and browser-token adoption, so the second `ensureFresh` cannot be answered
  locally and is forced to the wire. Nothing reports success on the strength of a capture — four
  harvested credentials in a row were once rejected on first use while login, doctor and `status` all
  called them healthy.

  **One attempt, and that is mechanical rather than policy.** The proof rotates, and rotation stales
  the browser session the next harvest would read, so attempt *n+1* is guaranteed to start from a
  worse position than attempt *n*. Looping does not merely spend a credential, it destroys the thing
  recovery depends on. The latch records *which* history happened — recovered, failed, or still in
  flight — because the advice built on it differs in each case.

- **`login` takes `reap_orphans`, for a profile held open by processes nobody can see.** Eleven
  orphaned browser processes holding `user-data-dir=~/.stockbit/browser-profile` once blocked every
  later login with "exited immediately without opening a debugging port", and clearing it took a
  manual `pkill` plus removing a stale `SingletonLock`. Nothing reaped them, because the spawn is not
  detached and the MCP login is fire-and-forget.

  It is **off by default and never automatic**, because it cannot tell an abandoned process from a
  working one: each launch polls a *fresh random* debugging port, so a perfectly healthy browser
  answering the port it was started with produces the same "exited immediately" failure. The Chartbit
  driver leaves exactly such a browser on that profile between calls. An automatic reap would have
  `SIGKILL`ed the chart the user was looking at.

### Changed

- **`login` refuses a *plain* login when the website session is provably dead, and names the one that
  works.** With a stale session Stockbit shows an expiry dialog over the form and closes the window
  before anything can be typed — measured, a plain login never once produced a usable form while
  `switch_account` worked four times out of four. `src/tools/system.ts` had never read the website
  session at all; the signal was computed in `status.ts` and only ever displayed. It now refuses on
  the *provable* verdicts only (`rejected` or `expired`, never "unknown"), and both the refusal and
  the auth error say out loud that `switch_account` signs the user out of Stockbit in that profile.

- **`fresh_profile` now says it does not fix the chart tools.** A throwaway profile gets the API
  session working while `~/.stockbit/browser-profile` — the profile the chartbit driver actually
  drives — stays signed out, so every chartbit tool keeps failing until a login runs without it.

- **`status` reports whether recovery is armed, available, spent or running.** It is the difference
  between "the next 401 fixes itself" and "the next 401 stops you", and nothing else said which. The
  rendered line appears only where recovery can actually happen — printing "auto-recovery: off" into
  `stockbit-auth status` would name a switch that does nothing in that process.


## [1.2.4] — 2026-08-31

> **1.2.3 was never published.** Its commits landed on `main`, but the release run failed at
> `npm test` before reaching `npm publish`, so no tarball, tag or GitHub Release was produced and
> the registry goes straight from 1.2.2 to 1.2.4. The 1.2.3 section below records what those
> commits changed; all of it ships here. The test that failed is fixed in this release.

### Fixed

- **A file URL was turned into a path with `.pathname`, which deleted the root on POSIX.**
  `test/batch.test.ts` built the path to the CLI it spawns as
  `new URL(...).pathname.replace(/^\//, "")`. `.pathname` yields `/C:/Users/...` on Windows and
  `/home/runner/...` everywhere else, so stripping the leading slash — correct for the Windows
  form — turned every POSIX absolute path into a relative one. The child then died with
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `<repo>/home/runner/work/.../bin/stockbit-batch.ts`.

  It passed on both Windows runners and failed on Ubuntu and macOS across node 22 and 24, which is
  exactly what blocked the 1.2.3 publish. Now `fileURLToPath`, which knows the difference and
  percent-decodes as well, so a checkout path containing a space works too. The test also asserts
  the file exists before spawning, because the original symptom was a resolver stack from inside
  tsx that said nothing about the caller having mangled the path.

### Changed

- **The package is published under Darren Wang.** The `author` field in `package.json`, the plugin
  and Desktop Extension manifests, the marketplace `owner`, and the MIT copyright line all now name
  Darren Wang — the account that publishes this package to npm (`dwstockbit`).

  This needed its own version because npm metadata is immutable per version: the `author` shown on
  npmjs.com for `1.2.3` and every release before it cannot be edited, only superseded. `1.2.4` is
  therefore identical to `1.2.3` in behaviour — no code changed, and the diff is bylines only.

  The GitHub namespace is deliberately untouched. Every `INo-xious` URL, and the
  `io.github.INo-xious/stockbit-mcp` name in `server.json`, identify where the repository lives and
  which MCP Registry entry this is; renaming them would point at a profile that does not exist and
  orphan the registry record. `.mailmap` is untouched for the same class of reason — it maps
  historical commits by a past identity onto a display name, and rewriting it would relabel commits
  that were not made by the new byline.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-08-31

Three fixes with one shape: a credential that does not work, reported as healthy. One at capture,
one at storage, one at the status that was asked about both.

### Fixed

- **A refused Keychain write threw the credential away, and retrying made it worse.** Reported from
  the field on macOS, reproduced twice: `login()` captured a session and then failed with "Keychain
  write failed" — a background MCP server cannot display the macOS authorisation prompt, so
  `security` is killed at the timeout or answers `errSecInteractionNotAllowed`. `websession.enc`
  landed in the same operation, so the directory was writable and only the Keychain write failed.

  The failure was non-fatal, which is what made it expensive. The captured token stayed in memory
  and served about ninety seconds of real calls; the server then fell back to the *stored* refresh
  token — revoked, because the login had just superseded it — and everything 401'd. So the server
  appeared to log in and broke a minute later. And because refresh tokens rotate and are
  single-use, every retry **spent a good token** to mint a replacement that was then discarded:
  retrying degraded the auth state rather than repairing it.

  A refused Keychain write now falls back to the encrypted file store. That is not a new security
  posture — it is the documented `STOCKBIT_FORCE_FILE_STORE` mode — but it *is* a downgrade, so it
  is announced on stderr and restated in `status` rather than mentioned once. If the file write
  also fails the error is raised: a login that stored nothing has not succeeded.

  The fallback is **recorded**, in `~/.stockbit/backend.json`, and this is the part that took the
  care. The backend is chosen per process and cached only in memory, so a one-off file write would
  be invisible to the next process: it would build a Keychain store, read the stale item still
  sitting there, and report it present. Nothing would ever look at the file. A recorded fallback
  now outranks platform detection, and the superseded Keychain item is deleted. It also keeps
  `reflock` honest, since lock paths differ by backend.

- **`status` reported presence as health.** "market-data session: ok (Stored.)" appeared beside
  "main session: fail" for the same credential, because one consulted the refresh journal and the
  other only asked whether a file existed. It now asks the journal too — no extra request, and
  nothing rotates. A login whose credential did not land is surfaced as a failed check, and a store
  that fell back to the file backend says so every time.

- **A login that captured a dead credential reported success.** Measured on 2026-08-29 and
  2026-08-30: four consecutive logins printed `Session captured (harvested from the
  already-signed-in browser)` and then `Session stored (valid ~6 day(s)) — you're set`, while the
  stored token was refused by the API with HTTP 401 on its very first request. `doctor` said
  "All checks passed" and `status` showed six days remaining at the same moment. Six *intercepted*
  captures in the same hours worked first time. Every layer agreeing that a broken credential is
  healthy is worse than a plain failure, because it sends the next hour of diagnosis elsewhere.

  The cause is that a harvested credential is read out of the browser's own `credentialStorage`
  because the profile was already signed in: nothing logged in, the refresh route never issued it,
  and the refresh route will not accept it. The login already knew which path had run and threw the
  fact away — the capture method reached the console as a display string and `LoginResult` carried
  only `{ captured, refresh }`.

  The fix is deliberately asymmetric, because the existing argument against a default proof is
  correct and is kept: proving costs a refresh, refreshes ROTATE, and rotation invalidates the
  browser session the login just established. But that argument rests on the token having arrived
  seconds ago in a live login response — true of an interception, false of a harvest. So an
  intercepted capture is trusted exactly as before, a harvested one is proven before success is
  claimed, `--verify` proves either, and a capture of unknown provenance is proven rather than
  assumed. A failed proof now names the cause and the remedy (`logout` clears the profile, so the
  next login must show a real form) instead of "the test refresh failed".

  The decision lives in `captureNeedsProof` rather than inline in the bin, for the reason
  `src/cliargs.ts` was extracted: a decision inside a bin is one no test can reach. Validation
  reads the store *after* `captureViaBrowserLogin` resolves, which matters — cleanup runs
  `syncStoreFromBrowser` and can adopt a different token after "Session captured" has printed.

- **`doctor` claimed more than it tested.** "All checks passed" now carries what it does not cover:
  its checks exercise the login machinery — drivable browser, interception, cookie read and clear —
  and none of them spends the stored token.

- **A revoked session was reported as no session at all.** A 401 from the refresh endpoint appended
  the no-token-at-all sentence — "No Stockbit session stored. Run `stockbit-auth login` first." — to
  a failure whose whole meaning is that a token *is* stored and Stockbit refused it. `status`, which
  reads the very journal that failure writes, said it correctly at the same moment: "present and
  unexpired, but Stockbit rejected it". Two reports of one state, disagreeing on whether the user
  had ever logged in, and the tool's version is the one an agent relays — sending the user to fix a
  login that was never the problem. Each token domain now carries a separate `rejected` message
  naming what actually happened; `missing` stays for the genuinely-absent case.

- **A refused website session was still reported as healthy.** `webSessionHealth` judged the refresh
  token's expiry and nothing else, so a revoked session — unexpired payload, every byte unchanged —
  read as `stored, ~6.0d left` while the browser opened a chart, received Stockbit's empty shell and
  threw. The chart path is the only place that can observe that refusal, and the observation died
  with the process that made it, so the next `status` went on quoting the expiry of a credential the
  browser had just proved dead. The health journal already answered exactly this question for the
  three token slots; its key now covers the website session too, the refusal is recorded where it is
  detected, and a recorded rejection outranks the clock. The fingerprint check comes with it, so a
  rejection about a session the user has since replaced stays quiet.

### Not changed

- The browser-preference behaviour from 1.2.2 is **not** the cause of the harvested-credential
  failure above, and was left alone. The first hypothesis was that the OS-default browser harvests
  while another intercepts; a Chrome login against a signed-in profile harvested too, and its token
  failed identically. What decides harvest-versus-intercept is whether the profile already holds a
  Stockbit session, not which browser holds it — which is why `logout` is the remedy.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-08-29

### Security

- **`trading-login --browser` stored a MAIN token in the SECURITIES slot and called it success.**
  The already-signed-in ladder harvests the browser's own credential out of `credentialStorage` —
  which is the stockbit.com web session, so what it returns is a market-data token *by
  construction*. `accept()` then wrote it to whatever slot the caller asked for. The trading login
  asks for `securities`, so a main-domain token landed under the securities name and the CLI printed
  "Trading session captured."; the 401 surfaced only on the test refresh that runs afterwards,
  leaving a poisoned slot that fails every trading read until someone runs `trading-logout`.

  The `slot` option's own doc stated the invariant in one direction only — "the `--browser` trading
  login captures a carina token, which must NOT land in the main slot" — and three guards enforce
  exactly that. Nothing guarded the reverse. The harvest tier now runs only for `main`, which is the
  only slot it can honestly fill, and an inner-closure invariant is pinned by a test the way the
  CDP-domain restriction above it is.

  Found by running the command, not by reading it.

- **`confirm: true` could skip the human entirely, and now cannot.** The order gate opened with
  `let via = options.confirm === true ? "explicit" : null`, and every later gate — including MCP
  elicitation, the only channel in this protocol that reaches a *person* rather than a model — was
  guarded behind `if (!via && …)`. So the caller's boolean did not add a gate to the human's; it
  removed the human's. A model could place an order the account holder never saw by asserting that
  the account holder had already agreed, and there is no undo for an order. `src/eipo/order.ts`
  carried a second, drifted copy of the same six branches, for the one commitment here that cannot
  be undone even by selling.

  The audit log made it worse: both cases wrote `via: "explicit"`, so afterwards nothing could tell
  "a person clicked yes" from "a model said one had" — on precisely the question the log exists to
  answer. And four places in this repo described the additive behaviour the code did not implement,
  while `login` had been doing it correctly all along. Order entry was weaker than opening a browser
  window.

  Now there is one gate, `src/trading/confirmation.ts`, shared by exchange orders and e-IPO, and the
  ask runs **before** the `confirm` check and behind no `via` test at all. A person who has not been
  asked is asked; a person who declines is obeyed whatever the model sent. A client that cannot ask
  still trades — that was ADR-0004's rule and it stands — but it is recorded as `explicit-unelicited`
  rather than `explicit`, and the `message` a model relays says in words that nobody was asked.
  Paper mode inherits all of it, because paper diverges after this gate and nowhere earlier; the
  report's proof-of-concept ran in `--paper` and is now a unit test in both modes.

  **The audit log's `via` vocabulary changed.** `"explicit"` is gone rather than kept alongside the
  new values, because keeping it would preserve exactly the ambiguity this closes. Every write now
  logs one of `elicited`, `remembered`, `auto-confirm`, `explicit-unelicited` or
  `explicit-elicit-disabled`, and the result carries an `elicitation` field beside it. The log is
  append-only JSONL, so lines written before this keep their old value and mean what they meant —
  but anything parsing it for the string `explicit` needs updating.

  The reporter also suggested a short-lived single-use token from `order_preview`. Declined, with
  reasons: `ticket_id` already is one — in memory, 120-second TTL, spent before the wire,
  fingerprinted and rechecked — and a second secret changes nothing, because the same model that
  reads the ticket id reads the second token from the same response. The gap was never token
  binding. It was that nothing ever reached a person. [ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-elicitation-is-decisive.md)
  records all of it, and ADR-0004 carries an amendment saying which of its sentences is superseded.

- **hono moved past four advisories it was never in a position to trigger.** The lockfile pinned
  `hono 4.12.33`, which four GHSAs cover — a ReDoS in the CORS middleware, an SSR disclosure through
  `memo()`, `Connection` header handling in the Proxy Helper, and a denial of service in the language
  middleware. All four are fixed in `4.12.34`; the lockfile now records `4.13.5`.

  This server never reaches any of that code. `hono` arrives only as a transitive dependency of
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, which offers it to HTTP transports; the single transport this server
  constructs is `StdioServerTransport`, and nothing under `src/` or `bin/` imports `hono`, an HTTP
  framework, or an HTTP transport at all. No CORS layer, language middleware, `memo()` or proxy
  helper is ever on a call path here. So this is hygiene — a clean `npm audit` and a quiet
  Dependabot — not a fix for anything that was exploitable. `package.json` gains no `overrides`
  entry: the SDK's own `^4.11.4` range already resolves to a patched `hono` on a fresh install, and
  pinning a dependency this server does not use would only make the pin the thing that goes stale.

  The same change corrects `package-lock.json`'s root `version` field, which still read `1.1.0` two
  releases after `package.json` moved on.

- **`redact()` had no rule for a bare `token=`, and one route puts its credential in the URL.** The
  e-IPO refresh (`GET /partner/refresh_token`) is the single request in this project that carries a
  secret in a query string, and `src/http/transport.ts` builds that URL and puts it into a
  `StockbitError` on the policy-block path. `StockbitError`'s constructor does redact — but the
  string path covered `Bearer`, `refresh_token`, `access_token`, `login_token`, `securities_token`,
  the Telegram bot token and JWT shape, and not a standalone `token`. `redactValue` had dropped
  `token` as an object KEY all along; it was the string path that missed, and a URL is a string.
  Whether anything leaked therefore came down to the e-IPO token happening to be JWT-shaped, and
  `test/redact.test.ts` already knew these tokens can be opaque — its `securities_token` case uses
  one.

  One pattern closes it, with `\b` so it cannot touch the five underscored names that have their own
  rules. `CLAUDE.md` states the invariant this serves: *"a `fetch` failure quotes the URL."* No
  demonstrated live leak — `src/http/client.ts` never has a URL in scope, and the one site that
  definitely embeds it is documented unreachable — so this closes a latent gap rather than an open
  one. The Telegram bot token pattern also gets its first test.

### Added

- **Three switches over who gets asked, all terminal-only.** `stockbit-auth trading-enable
  --elicitation required|when-available|never` (with `--require-elicitation` and `--no-elicitation`
  as sugar, mirroring the `--auto-confirm` pair). `required` refuses rather than send when no person
  can be reached, and `confirm: true` never substitutes; `when-available` is the default and what
  every existing install gets; `never` turns the ask off and leaves `confirm: true` as the only
  gate. One tri-state rather than two booleans, for the same reason `TradingMode` is three values
  rather than `enabled` plus a flag: a pair of booleans can be set to a combination that says
  nothing. An unrecognised value in the file coerces to the *default* — deliberately unlike `mode`,
  whose fallback is `off`, because falling back to `never` would silently weaken an account over a
  typo and `required` would silently brick one. `required` and `autoConfirm` contradict, and the
  ask wins, reported through the `autoConfirmIgnored` channel that already exists for a switch that
  is not doing anything.
- **"Don't ask again", granted by the person and by nothing else.** The confirmation dialog carries
  a second box the user ticks themselves, which waives the dialog inside five bounds that must all
  hold at once: it is a **new order** — a buy or a sell, never an amend, a cancel or an e-IPO
  subscription; the value of the order they actually approved; fifteen minutes; a fingerprint of the
  trading policy in force when they ticked it; and any later revocation. It has no cumulative budget
  and no symbol or side restriction, which is why the box reads "each new order this size or
  smaller" rather than "orders up to". It is created only once the order it was ticked on has been
  committed to, so an order that is then refused — including one whose ticket expired while the
  dialog was open, which is easy at human reading speed against a two-minute ticket — leaves no
  waiver behind, and the refusal says so. Held in memory and never written to disk: a restart ends
  it, and writing it would mean a module under `src/trading/` editing the settings file, which
  invariant 3 forbids.
- **A ticket whose checks have already failed is refused before anyone is asked.** Making the ask
  unconditional would otherwise have put a dialog in front of a person for orders that cannot be
  placed whatever they answer — an off-grid price, a symbol off the allow-list, a value over the cap.
  That is how a confirmation stops being read.
- **`trading_forget`, and `stockbit-auth trading-forget`.** The tool clears the grant in this server
  process, for a user who says "ask me again" without leaving the conversation; it is safe to call
  when there is nothing to clear and only ever makes the server ask *more* questions. The CLI
  command crosses process boundaries the only way a terminal can — by stamping
  `trading.confirmationsRevokedAt` into the settings file, which every order re-reads before the
  gate — so it reaches grants held by servers that were already running. `trading-disable` stamps it
  too, while deliberately leaving `elicitation` alone: two of its three values are stricter than the
  default, and loosening a stricter setting on the way to "off" would restore it weaker than the
  user left it.
- **`status` and `trading_status` answer "will I be asked?"** Both now report `elicitation`,
  `confirmationsRevokedAt` and the live grant — whether one is held, what value it is capped at, and
  when it expires. That question is about process memory, so no file could answer it and this is the
  only place it is visible.

### Fixed

- **`--help` no longer runs the command it describes.** All three CLIs read their flags with
  `argv.includes()`, so a token nobody asked about was treated as absent rather than as an error —
  and on 2026-08-29 that meant `stockbit-auth login --help` opened a real browser login, harvested
  the signed-in browser session and overwrote the stored credential. The same hole made
  `stockbit-live --help` run a scan (flag tokens are invisible to its positional scanner, so the
  command word defaulted) and `stockbit-alerts watch --help` start the long-lived daemon.

  Every subcommand of `stockbit-auth`, `stockbit-live` and `stockbit-alerts` now validates its argv
  against a declared table (`src/cliargs.ts`, one spec per bin) before any handler runs: an unknown
  flag or stray argument is refused with a message naming the token and everything that command
  accepts — the `STOCKBIT_TOOLS` rule, *an unknown token is an error, not a shrug* — and
  `--help`/`-h` prints usage with no side effects, on every subcommand and at the top level. Usage
  text is generated from the same table the validator reads, so help and reality cannot drift.
  Refusals keep each bin's established contract (auth exits 2 on stderr, live answers `ok:false`
  JSON on stdout with exit 1, alerts sets `process.exitCode` and exits naturally), so scripted
  callers still see the failure shape they already parse. `status --offline` stays accepted, because
  SECURITY.md tells vulnerability reporters to run it.

- **`stream_trending` and the shareholders token mint.** Trending dropped `date`, which the endpoint
  requires — without it the answer is 400 "Silakan periksa konten anda", and `{page, limit}` is
  refused too, so the tool had never returned a post. An omitted date now defaults to today in WIB,
  which is what "trending" means when nobody named a day. The shareholders token endpoint answers
  with the token under `data.value`, which no `/token/i` key search can find (`message` is the only
  string that mentions the word), so the mint always threw `schema_drift`; it is now read narrowly
  from that one route rather than by loosening the generic search. The chart call behind it still
  fails for a different reason and the tool stays `projected` — a partial fix, recorded as one.

- **Four endpoints that had never returned usable data now do.** Found by calling all 77 projected
  tools against a live account rather than by reading them. `order_queue` sent `symbol` where the
  endpoint wants `stock_code` and answers 400 to every other spelling. `stock_conversion` sent no
  paging to an endpoint that has no default and refuses without it. `chart_series` refused every
  series because `/charts/:symbol/daily` carries no `close` key at all — it carries the price in
  `value`, settled by arithmetic on the payload rather than assumption (a point read `value "2930"`,
  `change -20`, `percentage "-0.68"`, and 20/2930 = 0.68%). `stream_user` named one of its four
  fields out of sixty wire keys, because the user route spells them `postid`, `created` and a flat
  username where the per-symbol route nests them.

  The chart route also sends open, high, low and volume as EMPTY STRINGS, which is worse than
  absent: the keys are present so `unmapped` stayed clean, the flat-candle warning never fired, and
  `numberish("")` returns null so every bar silently took its close for all three. A caller could
  run candlestick patterns on a series of flat candles and be told nothing. A field that reads null
  on every row now counts as flat.

- **The browser trading login opened a stranger's profile page.** `startUrl` was
  `https://stockbit.com/trade`, and `/trade` is a Stockbit *username* route — so the window landed on
  whichever account owns that handle, the PIN form was never shown, and the capture then sat waiting
  for a carina response that could not arrive. Reported by an account owner who simply read the page
  they were sent to. The real trading URL is recorded nowhere in this repo and guessing a second one
  would repeat the mistake, so the command now opens the site, says in words to go to the trading
  page and enter the PIN there, and takes `STOCKBIT_TRADING_URL` from anyone who knows the exact page.

- **`bandar_detector` was wrong on real data, and the test suite was hiding it.** The Stockbit
  broker wire signs the sell side negative — every one of the 25 sell rows in the captured
  `test/fixtures/broker_summary_BBRI.json` carries `sval: "-7.5689625e+10"` and the like, and
  `test/core.test.ts` has asserted that since the fixture was committed. `getBandarDetector` read
  those figures as positive magnitudes, and four separate defects fell out of the one assumption.
  `netValueIdr = buyValueIdr - sellValueIdr` turned `(+) − (−)` into the SUM of both sides, so the
  flagship reading was 104× out: 5.8856e11 where the answer is 5.6838e9, and 1,947,760 lots where
  the answer is 18,690. `topDistributors` was exactly inverted, because a descending sort over
  negative numbers puts the *least* negative first — the tool returned the five SMALLEST sellers
  under the label "Largest net sellers first", and `skills/bandar-check` sends the model there "for
  a ranked read". And `topSellerShare`, `top3SellerShare` and `sellHerfindahl` were `null` on every
  real call, because a share of a negative total is refused — which the description told the model
  meant nothing had traded on the sell side, for every stock on IDX.

  1,411 green tests missed all of it because the only bandar tests ran on a hand-made fixture with
  POSITIVE sell values, three directories from the captured response that contradicts it. The suite
  proved the code agreed with itself. That is the failure mode this project's own `CLAUDE.md` warns
  about for the `WRITES` list — *"deriving it would make the test agree with the code"* — and it
  happened one directory over.

  The wire's signs are kept rather than laundered, and now documented at the top of
  `marketdetectors.ts` instead of being incidental. Ranking is by size of flow, so a sign cannot
  invert it. Concentration runs on magnitudes, as `excessConcentration` in `analysis/analyze.ts`
  already did — that function was sign-safe throughout and is why `analyze` was never affected.
  `netValueIdr` subtracts the MAGNITUDE of the sell total, which is right under either convention.
  The synthetic fixture now carries the real one's signs, and four new tests in `test/core.test.ts`
  assert the corrected numbers against the captured response itself rather than against a fixture
  written to agree.

- **The broker reader invented zeros, and could emit `NaN` typed as a number.** `num()` was
  `(s) => (s == null ? 0 : Number(s))`. `CLAUDE.md` states the rule it broke verbatim: *"Never
  invent a number. If a field could not be read, it is absent — not zero, not a default."* A broker
  whose net value could not be read was reported as having netted exactly zero, indistinguishable
  from one that genuinely netted zero, by the one tool whose job is telling those apart. And
  `Number("n/a")` is `NaN`, which poisons a sum, makes every share `null`, and serialises to `null`
  in JSON — the model received `"buyValueIdr": null` with no explanation.

  It now refuses rather than guesses, modelled on `asNumber` in `src/trading/account.ts`, with one
  deliberate difference: this wire is scientific notation (`"1.01635016e+11"`), which `asNumber`'s
  pattern rejects, so copying it verbatim would have turned every figure in the captured fixture
  into `undefined`. A separated number is still refused rather than parsed under a guessed decimal
  convention.

  **This changes the `./core` export surface.** `NormalizedBroker.netLots` and `.netValueIdr` are
  now optional. Anything summing them without a guard gets `NaN` where it used to get a number —
  which is the point: the number it used to get was made up. `BrokerSummary.unreadable` reports what
  was dropped, per side, so a total that covered 15 of 16 listed brokers says so instead of looking
  complete.

- **The evidence ladder was inferred from prose, and failed in both directions.** A regex over the
  description decided each tool's provenance. `screener_save` wrote its caveat as "has NEVER been
  observed" where the pattern knew only "has NOT been observed", so it registered as `read-back`
  with no error — the silent widening the ladder exists to prevent. In the other direction, because
  the pattern matches anywhere in free prose, a sentence about the `eligibility` FIELD's key names
  demoted `company_overview` to `projected`. Underneath both sat a fallback to `"observed"`: the
  strongest claim on the ladder was what a tool got for saying nothing at all.

  Evidence is declared now — on the tool or on its family — and a tool that declares neither fails
  to register. The regex survives only as a cross-check that raises when a declaration and a
  description disagree. All 139 tools carry exactly the evidence they carried before; the whole map
  is now written out by hand in `test/tools.test.ts`, beside `WRITES` and for the same reason.

- **The alerts daemon leaked one abort listener per tick.** `{ once: true }` removes a listener when
  the event FIRES, not when the timer resolves normally — which is what happens on every tick but
  the last. `bin/stockbit-alerts.ts` creates one `AbortController` for the life of the process, so
  the listeners accumulated on it: measured at ticks 1/5/10/15 the count went 0, 4, 9, 14, which at
  the default 60-second interval is about 1,440 a day and Node's `MaxListenersExceededWarning`
  eleven minutes in. Now `await delay(interval, undefined, { signal })` from `node:timers/promises`
  — the idiom `src/util/dirlock.ts` already imports. Measured at 0 across the same ticks, and a test
  pins it.

- **Paper and live disagreed about what `verified` means, and about what `write-failed` claims.** A
  paper rejection returned `verified: true`, though `OrderResult.verified` is documented as *"True
  only when the read-back actually showed the intended state"* and the live path returns `false` for
  the same class. ADR-0008's argument is that the outcome classes are precisely the part paper
  exists to rehearse, so the two reading differently is the rehearsal teaching the wrong thing.
  Separately, a `saveLedger` failure — a full disk, a read-only home — was caught by the same
  `catch` as the ledger's own refusals and reported as `rejected`, telling the user their order was
  turned down on its merits and giving them no reason to look at the filesystem.

  `write-failed`'s own definition was also wrong, and interestingly so: it read *"a synchronous
  client-side rejection, nothing was sent to the exchange"* while `performOrder`, `src/eipo/order.ts`
  and `src/account/log.ts` all return it for a 4xx the server answered — a request that demonstrably
  was sent. Three modules against one sentence, so the sentence changed rather than the
  classification. What the class actually asserts is true on both roads and is the part a user acts
  on: nothing landed, and the read-back agrees.

- **Order tickets were never evicted.** Nothing called `delete`; `peek` and `take` only *tested*
  expiry, and `clearTickets()` is tests-only. Every preview in a long-lived server left a whole
  ticket behind — its checks, its warnings, a copy of the policy in force, a market snapshot. Swept
  on issue now, after a retention window rather than on consumption: `take`'s "already used — an
  order may already have been placed from it" message is what stands between a person and a
  duplicate order, and it needs the spent slot to still be there.

- **The route table was built twice, and the guard sat beside the copy nobody used.** `ROUTES` was
  an object spread — which resolves a duplicate name by silently keeping the last, the exact failure
  the guard exists to catch — while `mergeRoutes(...)` was called underneath purely for its throw,
  its return value discarded. It builds the table now. Verified byte-identical: the same 153 routes,
  and `RouteName` is still the full literal union.

- **Smaller, each with a test.** `autoConfirm` without a value cap refused with advice to *"pass
  `confirm: true`"*, from a branch that runs before `confirm` is read — a caller following it looped
  forever. `order_preview` accepted `NaN`, `0`, negative and fractional `price`/`lots`, and did five
  sequential network reads before anything looked at them. The market cache key sorted `[k, v]` pairs
  by their string coercion, so it sorted on `"key,value"` rather than by key. `bollinger` took its
  variance about `sma`'s already-rounded mean, against the argument the same file makes for
  `highest` a few lines up. `stockbit-alerts --interval abc` gave `NaN`, which Node clamps to 1 ms —
  a typo turned a once-a-minute daemon into a tight polling loop.

- **The order dialog had been falling back to generic wording.** `passGates` called
  `options.elicit(ticket.summary)` with one argument, so every order and every IPO subscription got
  `_define.ts`'s defaults rather than words of its own. Orders, paper orders and subscriptions now
  each say what they actually are — a paper dialog says a local ledger rather than promising the
  exchange, and an IPO dialog says the money leaves the RDN account and cannot be cancelled by
  selling.
- **The duplicated e-IPO gate had drifted, and is gone.** Its cap-missing message was a short form,
  it had no guard for a commitment with no value, and it had lost "Do not set it on their behalf" —
  the single most load-bearing sentence in the refusal. One gate now serves both, so there is one
  wording and one test surface.

### Changed

- **14 tools moved from `projected` to `observed`, settled by live calls on 2026-08-29.**
  `company_subsidiaries`, `index_members`, `symbol_search`, `classification`, `corporate_actions`,
  `corporate_action_status`, `dividend_calendar`, `ipo_pipeline`, `insider_transactions`,
  `screener_favorites`, `screener_finitems`, `stream` and `news`. The bar was not "the route
  answered" but "rows came back and every field the tool names was read out of them" — `index_members`
  returning exactly 45 rows for LQ45 is the kind of agreement that settles a mapping. Six tools that
  answered with an empty page stayed `projected`, because an empty page proves a route and not a
  field name.

  `analyst_ratings` was promoted and then demoted again before this landed. It fetches two halves and
  its own note said "neither response shape has been observed"; the probe found an array of three
  rows and nothing in the result says which half produced it. A claim that cannot be distinguished
  from the wrong claim is not evidence.

  The same pass found ten tools that fail on their own documented arguments — four of them naming the
  exact missing parameter in the server's reply — plus three that succeed while extracting almost
  nothing, and confirmed the three e-IPO routes return 404. All of it is written down in
  [`docs/PENDING-VERIFICATION.md`](docs/PENDING-VERIFICATION.md) with the server's own words, because
  the next person to look should not have to re-run the account to find out.

- **The tool surface stopped restating itself.** Forty-six sentences appeared verbatim in more than
  one tool description — 28,237 characters, about 7,000 tokens, spent saying the same eight things
  over and over. The source was already DRY: `PROJECTION_NOTE`, `LOGIN_NOTE` and `UNVERIFIED` are
  shared constants. The cost was in the payload, where each is interpolated into ten, ten and seven
  descriptions and shipped on every connection.

  The conventions that are the same everywhere — what `readFrom`, `unmappedKeys`, `rowsFrom` and
  `source` mean, that an absent field is not a zero, what the evidence words mean, the order-outcome
  vocabulary, that nothing here rolls back — are stated once in the server `instructions`, which is
  exactly the place the protocol provides for them. A tool description now carries what changes the
  CALL; the skills carry what shapes the INTERPRETATION, which is why `bandar_detector`'s essay on
  what broker flow does not prove now lives in `skills/bandar-check`, where it is loaded at the
  point of use rather than on every connection forever.

  Measured with a real MCP client over the transport, not estimated: `STOCKBIT_TOOLS=all` went from
  ~58,100 to ~53,200 tokens of fixed context, and the default `core` profile from ~19,300 to
  ~18,700. Repeated prose fell from 28,237 characters to 14,314. That is short of the ~35,000 an
  outside review estimated for `all`, and the gap is worth naming: what is left is not duplication
  but each tool's own content, and cutting to that number means deciding a model needs less guidance
  at call time, which is a different judgement from removing something said nine times.

  Nothing was dropped silently. A test caught the one real loss while it was happening — every
  account read must say HOW to get a trading session, and a shortened note had left out the command
  name.

- **Seven dead symbols, and 39 exports that no longer widen the API.** Five were deleted outright,
  three of them carrying doc comments naming a consumer that never called them. `byFamily` and
  `dominantEvidence` were not deleted: `toolsdoc.ts` and `instructions.ts` each re-implemented the
  same grouping by hand, so the exported pair was simply the copy nobody used. They are generalised
  and wired up, and the generated reference is byte-identical afterwards. Two of the forty-two
  exports stay exported on purpose — they live in modules `src/core/index.ts` re-exports as the
  public `./core` entry point, where "widens the API for nothing" does not apply.

  `verifyAgainst` — the function that decides whether an order landed on the exchange — had no test
  naming it, only incidental coverage through `submitOrder` against a stub that always behaved. It
  has eight now, one per branch.
## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **The browser pin no longer outranks the user's default browser when nobody chose it.** 1.2.0
  taught selection to prefer the OS default, and on an existing install it changed nothing: the pin
  in `browser-profile.json` is written at login and is authoritative, so anyone who logged in before
  1.2.0 kept opening whatever the old Chrome-first preference table had picked. Measured on a real
  machine — default Opera, pin Chrome, written one day before the fix landed. The feature shipped and
  did nothing for exactly the people it was for.

  The defect was that an automatically-written pin is indistinguishable from a deliberate one, so
  the record now says which it is. `chosen: "explicit"` means the user named it through
  `STOCKBIT_BROWSER` and nothing overrules that; `chosen: "auto"` means login took whatever
  `findBrowser()` returned that day, and a drivable OS default now outranks it. Records written
  before the field existed read as `auto`, which is what they were — so this applies to existing
  installs **without a re-login and without rewriting anyone's file**.

  Switching browsers is safe here for one measured reason, and only that reason: the stored web
  session is *seeded* into whichever browser is opened. The profile directory genuinely is not
  portable between browsers; the cookies are, so the new browser comes up signed in rather than
  empty. Verified end to end by drawing on a live chart in Opera against a Chrome-created session.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-27

### Added

- **The browser the user actually uses.** Selection asked a preference table, not the operating
  system, so a machine whose default was Edge or Opera — but which happened to have Chrome installed
  for something else — got Chrome: a browser the user does not use, holding a profile they never see,
  asking them to log in to Stockbit a second time. **Observed** on a machine whose default is Opera
  and which was being driven through Chrome for exactly that reason. `defaultBrowserPath()` now asks
  the OS (Windows `UserChoice` registry key, macOS LaunchServices, Linux `xdg-settings`) and the
  answer outranks the table.
- **Advice instead of a dead end when the default cannot be driven.** Chartbit speaks the Chrome
  DevTools Protocol; Firefox and Safari do not implement it, so they can never be driven no matter
  whose default they are. `status` now names the browser, says the protocol is the reason, points at
  an already-installed Chromium browser or names one to install, and states that everything except
  chart drawing is unaffected — the REST tools never open a browser at all.
- **`status` reports how old the login is.** Three clocks were already on screen and none of them was
  the login: the web session's capture time (which moves every time a chart opens), the access
  token's 24h expiry, and the refresh token's ~7d deadline. `loggedInAt` is written once, by the
  login. Deliberately not a countdown — a login has no fixed lifetime, so the age is a fact and the
  session line is the deadline. A profile predating the field reads `unknown` rather than claiming an
  age of fifty-six years.

### Fixed

- **A test that was being excused as a flake.** `a widget whose activeChart() throws…` navigated with
  `Target.createTarget` and probed the page immediately. `createTarget` returns when the target
  EXISTS, not when it has loaded, so the probe could read an empty `innerText` and fail an assertion
  about a state the page had not reached. Every other browser-driven test here already polls; this
  one did not, and it lost the race more often on a loaded machine — which is when the suite runs.

### Verified

- Each discovered browser is launched for real, in a throwaway profile, and made to evaluate
  something: **Opera (the OS default), Chrome and Edge all answered CDP.** "Chromium-based" is not a
  guarantee that remote debugging is reachable, so `scripts/verify-default-browser.cjs` checks rather
  than assumes.
- Chartbit drawing **exercised end to end in Opera** against live IDX data, using an isolated store so
  the real session was untouched — confirmed byte-identical afterwards. The stored web session seeded
  across from the Chrome-created profile, so changing browsers did not require another login.
- Five full verification cycles across one hour, zero failures.

### Note

The browser pin is unchanged and still authoritative: a Chromium **profile** is not portable between
browsers, so the browser recorded at login keeps driving the chart. This changes which browser the
NEXT login picks, and `status` says when the pinned one is not the default.

## [1.1.0] – 2026-08-26

The refresh token does not expire. It gets **spent** — and the process spending it is the browser
this project drives itself. That is the whole of this release, plus the two things that were
expensive about using the server day to day.

See [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-browser-is-the-source-of-truth.md) for the decision behind it.

### Changed

- **`STOCKBIT_TOOLS` now defaults to `core`, not `all`.** This is the one change that may need
  action: a server with no configuration registers **40 tools**, not 138. Startup was never the
  problem — a built server boots and answers `status` in about 200 ms. The cost is per *turn*:
  `tools/list` for the full surface is around 220,000 bytes, roughly 55,000 tokens, in the model's
  context on **every message**; `core` is about a third of that. Set `STOCKBIT_TOOLS=all` to get
  everything back, or `STOCKBIT_TOOLS=core,<family>` to add one family. It also aligns the code with
  the docs, which have recommended `core` in the copy-paste snippet since the profile existed.
- **`stockbit-auth status` no longer refreshes by default.** A refresh *rotates* the token family
  and ends the website session, so the command a confused user runs first was the one that broke the
  other half of their setup. `--verify` opts in and says what it costs; `--offline` is kept as an
  accepted no-op because `SECURITY.md` tells vulnerability reporters to paste its output. The
  `status` tool's `live: true` description stops calling itself "one request to prove it works".
- **`logout` clears the website session and the access cache.** Through the MCP tool it cleared
  neither — while its own description called the browser profile "a SECOND copy of the session". A
  logout that leaves a working, decryptable Stockbit session on disk is not one.
- **Prompts a profile cannot run are no longer offered.** `pine_handoff` and `strategy_check` call
  `pine_script`, which is not in `core`, so under the new default they would have appeared in every
  client's menu and failed at their last step. A `core` server offers 6 of the 8.

### Added

- **The browser's rotated refresh token is read out of `credentialStorage`.** Every Chartbit tool
  opens a real Stockbit page; the page boots the SPA; the SPA calls `/login/refresh`; the family
  rotates. The browser then held token N+1 while `refresh.enc` held N, and the next market-data call
  401'd and told the user their session was gone. One user, one process, one chart was enough. The
  rotated token was already being captured and written to disk once per chart call — nothing had
  ever read it. New `src/auth/resync.ts` adopts it, under an ordering rule that **compares** rather
  than assuming the browser always wins, because three in-repo paths legitimately leave the store
  ahead.
- **A 401 now recovers from the stored website session** before declaring the session dead. A file
  read: no browser, no network, nothing interactive.
- **Login recognises an already-signed-in browser.** It used to land in the app, capture nothing, and
  report `Login timed out — no session captured.` fifteen minutes later. It now reads the credential
  out of the browser's own session and finishes in seconds; failing that, it signs the profile out
  and re-opens the form. `--switch-account` / `switch_account: true` clears first and never reuses
  what was there — for signing in as a different account.
- **A timeout that says where the page actually was**, and names the lever that fits: already signed
  in points at `--switch-account`, still on the form points at `--fresh-profile`, no Stockbit page at
  all points at `import-har`.
- **The 24-hour access token is shared between processes** via `~/.stockbit/access.enc` — one file,
  AES-256-GCM, mode `0600`, its own salt, each entry bound by fingerprint to the refresh token that
  minted it. Because rotation makes minting expensive, N clients each minting their own retire each
  other's credential. `STOCKBIT_NO_ACCESS_CACHE=1` opts out. **This is a real change to what is on
  disk — see `SECURITY.md`; on macOS it is a genuine reduction.**
- **`status` reports whether the stored token last *worked*.** You cannot prove a refresh token is
  live without spending it, so `~/.stockbit/session-health.json` records every refresh outcome
  instead — plaintext, `0600`, and containing **no tokens**, only an eight-hex-character digest.
  That is what lets `status` report a revoked or superseded session at **zero requests**, which no
  expiry check can ever do.
- **`status` warns when trading is on but the `trading` family is not registered**, and names
  `STOCKBIT_TOOLS=core,trading`. `core` has no order tools, so a user who deliberately ran
  `trading-enable --live` would otherwise find nothing and no explanation.
- **`doctor` gains three machine-checked rows**: which Keychain write mechanism works, that a
  credential can be read back out of a browser's own cookie, and that clearing it actually clears it.

### Fixed

- **The refresh lock's timings defeated it.** A legitimate holder can hold for `2 ×
  requestTimeoutMs` — one request plus the 401 retry — but the wait was 10 s and the staleness
  threshold 30 s against a 40 s worst case. A caller queued behind a healthy refresh gave up and
  refreshed in parallel, and a merely-slow holder had its lock broken as if it had crashed. Both are
  now derived from `requestTimeoutMs` and asserted in a test. A second hole in the same pair: the
  wait was shorter than the staleness threshold, so a lock left by a crashed process could never be
  broken by anyone.
- **Only one of nine credential-write paths took the lock.** `bootstrap`, `trading-login`,
  `trading-logout`, the e-IPO mint and both logout paths now do. The login capture deliberately
  stays outside it, and says so.
- **On macOS the lock was in the wrong place.** The Keychain is machine-global while `lockPath()`
  resolved under `$STOCKBIT_STORE_DIR`, so two clients with different store dirs took *different
  locks over one credential*. It is now backend-aware; the file backend is unchanged.
- **A rotated token could be lost outright.** If `store.set` threw — a locked Keychain, a denied ACL
  prompt, EPERM from an antivirus — the exception propagated and the rotated token was gone
  permanently, because the one it replaced was retired server-side the instant the pair was issued.
  A transient disk error cost a forced re-login. The access token is now kept first, the write is
  retried, and the rotated token is held in memory for this process's next refresh.
- **The 401 retry is bounded at one.** It terminated in principle; the failure mode of being wrong
  was unbounded recursion inside a held lock.
- **`~/.stockbit` could be created world-listable.** `src/util/dirlock.ts` made the parent directory
  with no mode, and on a fresh machine the lock is often the first thing written there. The files
  were always `0600`; the directory was the part that was wrong.
- **`login` failing to capture no longer hides the reason.** Its `flushAndCloseBrowser` window is
  exactly SPA boot, which rotated away the token just written while `done = true` blocked
  re-capture — so the credential could be dead before the command returned.

### Security

- **The Keychain token stops travelling as a process argument.** `keychainWriteArgs` returned
  `["-w", token]`, visible in `ps` to any process running as the same user — which also *bypasses*
  the Keychain ACL that would otherwise prompt. `man security` recommends the opposite of what the
  old comment claimed. The value now goes in on stdin, and the write **reads it back** before
  keeping it: `security` prompts twice, and feeding it once exits 0 while storing an empty string.
  The `argv` form is retained as a fallback, and `doctor` reports which one ran.
- `TokenStore.readState()` distinguishes "nothing stored" from "could not find out". A locked
  Keychain read as `null` — the same value as "you have never logged in" — so `status` advised a
  re-login, which on macOS means overwriting a credential that was never in doubt.

### Docs

- [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-browser-is-the-source-of-truth.md), and `docs/PENDING-VERIFICATION.md`
  gains a section for the five things this work left unmeasured, each with the one-line experiment
  that would settle it.
- `src/config.ts` and `docs/stockbit-api.md` called token rotation "unverified". It is Observed, and
  two other comments in the repo already treated it as settled — leaving the hedge in one place is
  how the lock gets removed as defensive padding.
- `docs/FEATURES.md` gave the login timeout as 5 minutes; the code has said 15 for some time.
  `CONTEXT.md` described three credentials; there are four. `docs/TESTING-LOGIN.md` stops quoting a
  test count that goes stale, and gains manual-matrix rows 12–15.

## [1.0.1] – 2026-08-25

Tagged and published at the time; this section is written retrospectively, because the release went
out without one.

### Fixed

- **`chartbit`: the reused-tab reload race.** Every `chartbit_open` / `screenshot` / `draw` against
  an already-open tab re-navigated it, even though the tab had been found by matching that exact
  symbol's own URL and was already correct. Combined with a readiness check that waited only for the
  widget object rather than for the datafeed to paint, this raced a needless reload on every call and
  returned a chart that read as ready with zero candles on screen. Fixed by dropping the re-navigate
  and gating readiness on the series actually having loaded bars, plus anti-throttling launch flags
  and `Target.activateTarget` against the window being backgrounded.
- **`chartbit`: entity ids were never awaited.** `createShape` / `createMultipointShape` /
  `createStudy` return a Promise in this TradingView build rather than the id directly. Every stored
  `tvEntityId` serialised to the literal string `"[object Object]"`, so `chartbit_clear`
  `scope: "ours"` silently no-opped while reporting success and left drawings on the real chart.

## [1.0.0] – 2026-08-25

The first public release. Everything below the tag was already working; this is what it took to be
installable by someone who is not the author.

### Added

- **`status`, `login` and `logout` tools** (ADR-0007). `status` answers "is this working, and what
  do I run" — version, which of the three sessions exist (never the tokens), the trading mode, the
  IDX session clock in WIB, and one next command. It answers with no session at all, which is where
  every new user starts. `login` opens a browser and returns before the person finishes, because no
  MCP client's tool-call timeout is measured in minutes; `status` is the poll. The PIN and the
  trading switch stay at a terminal, and no result from any of the three ever carries a token.
- **Paper trading** (ADR-0008). `stockbit-auth trading-enable --paper` trades against a local
  ledger: no exchange, no session, no PIN, and the identical ticket protocol so nothing about the
  live path is a surprise later. Fills are approximate in three stated ways and every result says
  `PAPER ACCOUNT — no real money.`
- **MCP prompts** for the eight built-in workflows, each carrying guidance on how to present its own
  result rather than a generic instruction to be helpful.
- **`position_size`** — lots from a risk budget, floored, with commission, break-even, R targets and
  both prices checked against the IDX tick grid and today's auto-rejection band.
- **Telegram alert delivery.** The channel that reaches a phone, since a desktop toast fires at a
  laptop that is shut.
- **Tool profiles** — `STOCKBIT_TOOLS=all | core | families,tools`. `core` is 40 tools, which is
  Cursor's cap. `system` is never filtered out.
- **`docs/TOOLS.md`**, generated from the running server, with a test that fails when it is stale.
- **`README.id.md`** in Bahasa Indonesia, and two sample images rendered from synthetic data.
- **Distribution**: npm, the MCP Registry, a Claude Code plugin with six skills, and a Claude
  Desktop Extension.
- **CI on every push** — typecheck, test, build, smoke, `check:pack` and a `docs/TOOLS.md`
  freshness check across Ubuntu, macOS and Windows on Node 22 and 24, plus a dependency audit and an
  offline link check. Three operating systems because the token store, the file locks and the
  browser probe are all different on each, and a suite that only ever runs on the author's Mac is a
  suite that tests one of them.
- **Community plumbing** — issue templates that ask for `stockbit-auth doctor` output and make you
  tick a box saying you scrubbed it, a pull-request checklist naming the three invariants, and
  Dependabot.
- **`CONTEXT.md`** — a glossary, so "session" stops meaning two things.
- **`docs/VERIFICATION.md`** — the evidence ladder, what each family is, and how to settle a
  projection.

### Changed

- **Breaking: `stream_post` is now `stream_post_detail`.** It reads one post by id; it was named
  like a verb, and nothing here can post to the stream.
- **Breaking: Node 22 is the floor** (`src/auth/cdp.ts` needs a global `WebSocket`, so the ">=20" it
  claimed would have failed at login).
- **Breaking: `trading-enable` now requires `--paper` or `--live`.** A bare invocation is refused:
  the two differ by everything, and a default is a decision made for someone who did not make it.
- **Breaking: settings are v2.** `trading.enabled: boolean` becomes `trading.mode: off | paper |
  live`, migrated on read — a v1 `enabled: true` becomes `live`, because that is what it meant.
  `STOCKBIT_TRADING` can now lower `live` to `paper`, and still cannot raise anything.
- Tool registration goes through one door. The thirty-three older tools no longer bypass it by
  intercepting `server.tool`, which had made every one of them reachable from a saved workflow
  recipe. Each tool now carries its family and an evidence word on `_meta`.
- The MCP `instructions` enumerate the write tools from the surface itself. They said "the four
  order tools and the chartbit_* writes" while twenty-two tools could change something.
- `stockbit-auth status` renders the same report the `status` tool returns, and `--json` prints it
  redacted — which is what `SECURITY.md` asks a reporter to paste.
- The server reports the version from `package.json` rather than a literal that said `0.1.0` for as
  long as nobody remembered to change it.

### Fixed

- **`STOCKBIT_STORE_DIR` is honoured everywhere.** `src/render/write.ts` hard-coded `~/.stockbit` at
  three sites, so chart SVGs, generated Pine and Chartbit screenshots escaped the store — including
  under a test that had carefully pointed it at a temp directory. The escape *succeeded*, which is
  why nobody noticed.
- The Telegram bot-token redaction pattern could not match the one place the token actually leaks —
  inside the Bot API URL — because a `\b` anchor never matches after the letters `bot`.
- `npm pack` shipped 247 files and 3 MB, including the source tree, the tests and a `dist/` left
  over from an earlier refactor. It now ships 129, checked by an allow-list on every push.
- **`STOCKBIT_NO_BROWSER` is read truthily**, not as `=== "1"`. The Desktop Extension exposes it as
  a checkbox, and Claude Desktop substitutes a ticked box into the environment as the string
  `"true"` — so a user could tick "never open a browser window" and watch one open. `0`, `false`,
  `no`, `off` and empty mean not suppressed; anything else suppresses, which is the safe way round
  for a flag whose only job is to refuse.

### Security

- `SECURITY.md` now states that off macOS the credential file's key is derived from hostname and
  username — **obfuscation, not a vault** — and asks for the redacted `status --json` in reports.
- Bot tokens are redacted by shape and dropped by key.

### Docs

- A public README with install instructions per client, a decision table, the verification status,
  the safety model and a long disclaimer; `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, a
  documentation index, and an ADR index.
- Private material removed from the tree and from every blob in the history: a collaborator's
  brokerage balance, a real watchlist, Windows home paths in end-user instructions, and the
  maintainer's own name as a test fixture.
- `STOCKBIT-API.md` became `docs/stockbit-api.md` and carries the unofficial/ToS disclaimer the
  README had carried alone.

## [0.1.0] – 2026-08-24

Everything below is the development history that led to 1.0.0, kept because most of it is about
undocumented API behaviour that is expensive to rediscover.

### Full Stockbit coverage, confirm-gated trading, and drawing on the real chart (2026-08-24)

35 tools became 134; 544 tests became 1041. The read surface now covers what the web UI shows, and
for the first time this server can do things to an account: place an order, subscribe to an IPO,
draw on the chart, and edit watchlists and saved screens. Each is off by default or per-action
confirmed, and each has a decision record.

**One host became three, with three credentials.** `exodus` (market data), `carina` (Stockbit
Sekuritas), `api-sekuritas` (e-IPO), each with its own store slot, its own refresh chain and its own
placement rule: the main session refreshes with a header, carina with a `refresh_token` in the
BODY, e-IPO with the token in a QUERY parameter. `AuthKind` distinguishes all three rather than
assuming a bearer, because assuming one is how a credential gets sent somewhere it was never issued
for. `docs/stockbit-api.md` claimed carina needed an `Authorization-Carina` header; the current bundle
says a plain bearer, and it was wrong.

**`/charts/{SYM}` was never locked — the spelling was wrong.** This project recorded it for months
as "real, and still unusable" after probing `timeframe` / `tf` / `interval` / `resolution` against
`daily`, `1D`, `D`, `DAILY`, `TIMEFRAME_DAILY`. Every one of those was uppercase. The client sends
lowercase *windows*: `?timeframe=1w|1m|3m|ytd|1y|3y|5y`. A whole series in one request, against the
12-row paged walk it replaces — roughly 40x fewer requests for every scan, backtest and alignment.
The lesson kept in `docs/stockbit-api.md` §11d: a 400 naming a parameter means the route is real, and
says nothing about whether the values tried were the right *shape* of value.

**Chartbit saving was never retired; this project was reading the retired half.**
`/chartbit/{symbol}/layout` really is a server-side stub that accepts every valid body and stores
nothing — twelve probes established that and they were right about those two routes. The chart page's
own `save_load_adapter` writes to `/chartbit/charts` and `/chartbit/chart-drawings`, content encoded
as base64 of a ZIP holding one `layout.json`. `src/core/layout.ts`, `src/core/layoutwrite.ts` and the
tools `chart_layout` / `chart_layout_save` are gone; `src/chartbit/` replaces them, and the account
owner had said drawings persist before the bundle confirmed it.

**Drawing happens in the user's own browser** (ADR-0005), over CDP, in a visible window, through the
TradingView widget's own API. That bypasses the transport tripwire entirely — the requests are made
by Stockbit's JavaScript with Stockbit's credential — which is why it needed its own decision record
rather than being an implementation detail. The driver enables only the `Page` and `Runtime` CDP
domains: never `Network` or `Fetch`, which can read response bodies, and a drawing driver that could
read traffic could read the session token. A test asserts it on the source.

**Order entry (ADR-0004) inverts three of ADR-0003's rules**, because an order has no undo. Lock
contention refuses instead of proceeding; a failed verification never rolls back, and nothing ever
auto-cancels, because the rollback for an order is another order sent on a guess; and nothing throws
after the request goes out, because a thrown error is a caller's licence to retry and a retry here
is a duplicate. Seven outcome classes, and only `ok` means the order is on the book and was seen
there.

The protocol is two steps with a person in the middle: `order_preview` builds a ticket, the write
tools take a **ticket id and a confirmation and nothing else** — no price, no quantity — so the order
placed is the order described. Tickets live in memory, expire in two minutes, are spent before the
request goes out, and are fingerprinted so one altered between the steps is caught. Where the client
supports MCP elicitation the human is asked directly, in addition to the caller's confirmation.

**Checks that failed and checks that could not be RUN are different facts.** Nothing on the trading
host has been observed live — reading it needs a PIN this project never stores — so a projection that
does not recognise an account's key names leaves buying power or a position unknown. Failing those
closed would make order entry impossible the first time a key name did not match, for a reason with
nothing to do with the order. They pass, marked `unverified`, named in the warnings, and counted in
the summary the user reads.

**The account modules project and never pass a row through**, which is the opposite of the rule
every market-data module follows. There, an unmapped field is a metric nobody has named and hiding
it loses information. On a brokerage response it is as likely to be an account number, and a tool
result is text a model relays — so `unmappedKeys` reports the NAMES and drops the values. Names,
account, RDN and SID are masked inside the core module rather than at the tool boundary, so no
future call site can reach the unmasked value.

**Writes are unreachable from a saved workflow.** `define.write` registers a tool with the client
and deliberately does not add it to the handler map `workflow_run` looks names up in — enforced by
construction, asserted on a real server. A recipe is data: a name and a list of steps.

**A bug the e-IPO tests caught, worth recording because the shape generalises:** a failed read-back
and a read-back that says "nothing there" were both `null`, so a 4xx that left nothing behind
reported as `outcome-unknown` — "we cannot tell, do not resend" — when the honest answer was a clean
failure. Two facts that are opposites must not share a representation.

**Also:** watchlist and screener edits (ADR-0006) with their own audit log, `screener_save` as a
separate route row from `screener_run` because the only difference on the wire is one body field;
`progress/build.mjs` scanning every module under `src/tools/` rather than one file; and the route
guard reading code rather than prose, so a module can name the endpoint it calls in its own
documentation.


### `analyze` — the synthesis layer (2026-08-10)

One new tool. 35 tools, 544 tests. No new route, no new request shape: it composes sources the
server already reads, so the closed route table and ADR-0002's boundary are untouched.

**The gap it fills.** Every other tool answers one question from one source. `deep_dive` fetches
five of them and weighs none, because the workflow engine deliberately refuses to compute — steps
are declarative, there are no conditionals and no arithmetic over results. So nothing here has ever
turned six readings into a position on them. Four weighted pillars now do: broker flow (0.35), trend
across timeframes (0.30), valuation (0.20), candlestick patterns (0.15). Broker flow leads because
it is the only pillar no other data source in the world can serve.

**Confidence is capped at 90 by construction, and the cap is the honest part.** It scores evidence
quality — completeness (30), agreement (30), distance from neutral (20), freshness (10) — and is
explicitly not a probability that price moves the way the lean points. A scale running to 100 invites
exactly the reading the data cannot support.

There is a second reason the word needed care. `Detection.confidence` in `patterns.ts` already means
something else — how closely a candle matches its textbook proportions — and that module is emphatic
it is not a probability either. The two must never be summed or averaged. Pattern confidence is used
only as a within-pillar ranking weight and cannot reach `Confidence.value`; a test asserts the cap
holds when every pillar is saturated.

**A missing pillar is not a neutral vote.** Its weight is redistributed across what was readable and
it costs completeness, so a three-pillar report stays on the −100…+100 scale while reading as the
thinner report it is. Folding it in as a zero instead would drag every lean toward neutral and
nothing in the output would show why. The same distinction runs through the pillars themselves: an
**unreadable timeframe abstains** rather than voting flat, because `alignment()` scores both
"genuinely flat" and "the averages could not be computed" as 0 and only the second is an abstention.

**A total failure errors instead of answering.** This is the correction the first stdio smoke test
forced: against a dead token every source threw, and the tool returned `success: true` with
`lean: "neutral"` and a confidence of 15 — a result that looks like an analysis and is actually a
login prompt. That is the `top_movers` failure shape exactly, where an always-empty list was
indistinguishable from a working tool. Partial failure still degrades per source and names what it
lost; only a report with nothing in it throws, and it rethrows the **original** error so an expired
token is reported as an expired token rather than as "no valuation metric could be located".

**Two limits are structural and are stated in every response** rather than left for a reader to
discover: there is no analyst consensus anywhere in this server, and valuation is scored against
absolute bands because Stockbit's industry aggregate is not in the route table — so "is that cheap
*for a bank*" cannot be asked, and the pillar is systematically wrong in a predictable direction for
banks, property and cyclicals. Community sentiment is fetched and **counted, never scored**: a
keyword tally over ~30 Indonesian-language retail posts would be noise wearing a label.

**The fetches are sequential on purpose.** Concurrent first-calls are what outran the refresh lock
and invalidated the stored token on 2026-08-05. A test asserts no two upstream reads overlap —
mutation-checked by rewriting them as `Promise.all`, which fails it.

### Analytics parity with the TradingView MCPs (2026-08-09)

Six new tools — `backtest`, `strategy_compare`, `patterns`, `timeframe_alignment`, `scan`,
`price_bands` — plus two workflows. 32 tools, 498 tests.

**Eight shipped defects fixed first.** Two of them meant an advertised feature had never worked:
`morning_scan` aborted on every single run (it fanned out over `steps.movers.data.results`, but
`top_movers` returns its rows as `data`), and `top_movers` sent a camelCase spelling this project
invented while Stockbit's own client sends `topgainer` — the endpoint answers 200 with an empty
list, and the tool's description explained an empty hotlist away as a closed market, so a request
that never worked looked exactly like one that did. Also: three `broker_summary` enum values that
do not exist upstream (`BUY`/`SELL` where the modes are `NET`/`GROSS`; `NEGOTIATED`/`CASH` where
the boards are `NEGO`/`TUNAI`, with `ALL` missing entirely); `getBars` with `to` and no `from`
returning 4 bars where 24 were asked for while reporting `truncated: false`; doc comments saying
"shares" where the runtime means lots; `sectors` dropping every field but three, including the
`parent` its own schema declared; a grammar invariant claimed in a comment and not held; and
`stockbit-auth status` reporting a dead token as healthy because it read the JWT expiry rather than
trying a refresh.

**Backtesting.** Entry and exit use the condition grammar the alerts and the Pine emitter already
share, so one strategy is a local backtest, a live alert and a TradingView script rather than three
that drift. The execution model is the feature: signals read at the bar close and fill at the
**next** bar's open, stops win ties on an ambiguous bar, gaps fill at the open rather than the
level, and an ARA/ARB-locked session cannot be filled at all. Absence of lookahead is proved
structurally — a backtest over the first N bars must be a prefix of the backtest over all of them.

**Walk-forward**, with two things it would be easy to get wrong: efficiency is measured **per bar**
(dividing total returns compares a 65% train segment against a 35% test segment, which scored a
deliberately stationary series at 0.54 and would have graded every honest result "overfit"), and
`inconclusive` is checked before any other verdict. On ~500 real daily bars it usually will be.

**Warm-up arithmetic, measured rather than assumed.** SMA and Bollinger terminate, so an SMA 50
needs 51 bars and not the 151 the old flat 3× asked for — five upstream pages instead of thirteen
per symbol, which is what makes a universe scan viable. Wilder and EMA converge, and 3× is *not*
enough: the residual at 3× is 2.75 RSI points, the difference between 29.9 and 32.6 and therefore
between a screen hit and a miss. Raised to a measured 5×.

**One vocabulary.** The overlay/panel preset table was declared three times — twice identically in
`register.ts` and once hand-rolled inside `price_chart`, which had fallen behind and drew no
`ema50` and no ATR panel. A chart that silently omits a line the alert it explains references is
worse than one that refuses the argument.

Still pending live verification (the stored token was already dead): the watchlist and screener
routes, the two enum fixes, and the ARA/ARB field spellings. See `docs/PENDING-VERIFICATION.md`.


### Fixed — counterparty bars are now fully connected

A counterparty's bar is its TRUE total, but the drawn buyers explain only part of it — 23–44% on a
typical stock. The remainder had nothing attached to it, so every bar read as two disconnected
pieces with the ribbons touching only the top one.

The remainder is now fed by a synthetic **"other buyers"** source in the left column, mirroring the
"+N others" band already used on the counterparty side. Every bar is fully connected, every ribbon
still means the same thing (an amount that moved between two parties), and the totals reconcile on
both sides. Shading the shortfall was tried first and rejected: two tones on one bar read as two
bars, which is the confusion it was meant to remove.

No synthetic source is created when nothing is missing.

### Fixed — counterparty bars showed a partial sum; the chart is now buyer→seller only

**A seller's bar was labelled with only the flow from the buyers drawn**, not that seller's actual
total. Measured on TPIA over 27 Jul–3 Aug 2026, XL's bar read **374.54B against a real total of
615.57B** — 61% — and a thinner broker read 16%. That is the worst kind of wrong: a plausible number
that quietly understates. Bars now carry the counterparty's true total from `top_broker_sell`, so a
partly-filled bar means the buyers shown explain only part of what that broker sold — which is
information, not a rendering fault. A `max(drawn, true)` guard keeps ribbons inside their bar if the
two ever disagree.

**The `side` option is gone.** The chart is always laid out BUYER → SELLER, matching Stockbit's own
Broker Distribution. Rendering the mirror view invited exactly the confusion it caused: a
sellers-first chart compared against Stockbit's buyers-first UI looks like a data discrepancy when
the underlying numbers are identical.

### Fixed — market board, and the diagram now names its columns

**`market_board` was being omitted entirely.** An earlier probe sent broker summary's
`MARKET_BOARD_REGULER`, got a 400, and concluded this endpoint takes no board. Wrong: the parameter
is right, the value prefix is `MARKET_TYPE_`. The endpoint was therefore running on its default,
which happens to be REGULER, so numbers were correct by luck rather than by request. Now sent
explicitly, with `ALL` / `NEGO` / `TUNAI` exposed — and it matters: BRMS over 27 Jul–3 Aug 2026 has a
top buyer of 120.33B on REGULER and 978.15B on ALL, because ALL folds in negotiated blocks.

**The chart now labels its columns BUYER and SELLER**, coloured and swapping sides with `side`, and
the subtitle states the direction ("who the top buyers bought FROM") plus the board. Previously the
only hint was "top sellers → counterparties", which is easy to read backwards — and comparing a
sellers-view chart against Stockbit's buyer-first UI looks like a data discrepancy when it is not.

**Verified against Stockbit's own UI**, same stock and window: top buyer XL 120.33B and its seven
largest counterparties match to the decimal. Their UI labels a non-contiguous subset of ribbons,
which is what made it look like values were missing.

### Changed — `broker_distribution` always renders an SVG

The diagram is no longer a separate tool. `broker_distribution` now renders the flow, writes the
`.svg` (to `~/.stockbit/charts/` unless `save_path` says otherwise), returns it as an image, and
reports the path in `savedTo`. It deliberately returns **no per-broker table** — the picture is the
output, and `broker_summary` is where the figures live.

The file is written on every call rather than on request, because MCP clients differ in whether they
render an inline SVG; a caller whose client shows nothing still has a path to open. Filenames are
deterministic (`SYMBOL-side-window-dataType.svg`) so repeating a query overwrites instead of piling
up.

Renders the broker-to-broker flow as an SVG Sankey: source brokers on the left, the counterparties
they traded against on the right, ribbon thickness proportional to the amount, coloured by
Asing/Lokal/Pemerintah. Dark theme by default, `light` available. Returned as an MCP image content
block plus a text summary, with an optional `save_path`.

**No new dependencies.** A raster renderer would mean a native build and a platform matrix; the SVG
is built as a string, so this costs nothing at install time and scales losslessly.

**Escaping is a security control here.** Broker codes come from the API and are interpolated into
markup a browser executes, so every value goes through `esc()`, with tests firing `</text><script>`
payloads through both the broker code and the symbol.

**Node sizes are derived from the ribbons that are actually drawn.** An earlier revision sized target
nodes from one population while routing ribbons from another; the two disagreed, so ribbons
overflowed their bar and ran off the bottom of the canvas across the legend, counterparties ranked
just past the per-source cap received no ribbon at all, and when nothing was globally folded a
source's tail was discarded in silence. Deriving bars from ribbons makes that unrepresentable — a
node height IS the sum of what lands on it — and four invariant tests pin it (nothing off-canvas,
nothing silently dropped, no node without an incoming ribbon, and asking for more never charts less).

### Added — `broker_distribution` (broker-to-broker flow matrix)

New tool. Where `broker_summary` reports *how much* each broker net-bought or net-sold,
`broker_distribution` reports *who was on the other side*: for each top broker, the counterparties
and the amount that moved between them.

```jsonc
{ "detail":        { "code": "AK", "type": "Asing", "amount": 445525972000 },
  "distribute_to": [ { "code": "BK", "amount": 77101438000 }, … ] }
// AK accumulated Rp 445.5B, of which Rp 77.1B came from BK
```

`data_type=VALUE` returns IDR; `data_type=VOLUME` returns **lots** (1 lot = 100 shares), matching the
convention broker summary uses. The unit was verified arithmetically, not assumed — value/volume
lands on the right per-share price only after dividing by 100, so labelling it "shares" would have
understated every quantity by 100x.

Served by a different backend service (`/order-trade/broker/distribution`) which takes the symbol as
a **query parameter**, not a path segment. Accepts either a `period` preset (`TB_PERIOD_*`) or an
explicit `from`/`to` window, reusing the date validation added for `broker_summary`.

> ⚠️ **`market_board` is rejected by this endpoint (400)** — unlike `broker_summary`, where it is
> expected. Copying the summary parameter builder breaks it. There is a regression test.

> ⚠️ **`period` and `from`/`to` are mutually exclusive here too**, and built as separate return
> shapes for the same reason as `broker_summary`.

**Entitlement.** Stockbit gates this feature behind a minimum account balance of **Rp 10,000,000**.
In their web app the gate is enforced **client-side** — the micro-frontend receives an `isEligible`
prop and, when false, renders a blurred overlay over placeholder data and never issues the request.
Whether the server independently refuses an ineligible account is **unverified**: it could not be
observed from an entitled account. The ineligible path is therefore handled defensively — an HTTP
403 names the balance gate as the **most likely** cause while preserving the server's own message and
`error_type`, and 401 remains a genuine auth failure that is never blamed on the balance. Asserting
the balance outright would have been wrong: this project's config already documents that these
routes "400s/403s ... without browser-shaped Origin/Referer", so a Cloudflare or header 403 would
have told the user to deposit Rp 10,000,000 to fix something money cannot fix — with the real error
text destroyed. Both mappings are asserted by test.

### Added — `broker_summary` date ranges

`broker_summary` accepts an optional `from`/`to` window (`YYYY-MM-DD`). `from == to` queries a
single historical day; a range queries a window. Omitting both keeps the previous behaviour exactly.

```jsonc
{ "symbol": "BBRI" }                                            // latest session
{ "symbol": "BBRI", "from": "2026-07-30", "to": "2026-07-30" }  // one past day
{ "symbol": "BBRI", "from": "2026-07-28", "to": "2026-08-01" }  // a window
```

The server aggregates net flow across the window in **one request** — there is no day-by-day
looping and no client-side weighting to do.

> **⚠️ `period` and `from`/`to` are mutually exclusive, and violating that fails silently.**
> With `period` present the dates are ignored and the API answers **HTTP 200 with the latest
> session** — a caller asking for last week receives today's numbers, with no error and no schema
> drift to catch it.

For that reason the two query shapes are built as separate return statements rather than "set
`period`, then delete it when dates exist". The delete form leaves one line between correct
behaviour and a confident wrong answer, and its removal would look innocuous in review.

Measured API behaviour (see `docs/stockbit-api.md` §4a):

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| `from`+`to`, dashed, no `period` | real range |
| `from` alone (or `to` alone) | **200, latest session** — the lone date is ignored |
| `date_from`/`date_to`, `start_date`/`end_date` | **200, latest session** — names ignored |
| `20260728` or `2026/07/27` | error — dashes required |
| `from` > `to` | error |
| span | no server limit found; 7d…1825d all served in one request |

`date_from`/`date_to` and `start_date`/`end_date` are accepted at the tool layer as **aliases**,
normalised onto `from`/`to`, and never sent. Two different values for the same end are rejected
rather than resolved by a precedence rule.

- **New:** `src/core/dates.ts` — the single door a user-supplied date passes through before it can
  shape a request, in the same spirit as `src/symbol.ts`. Anchored format, real-calendar validation
  (`2026-02-30` matches the pattern but `Date` would roll it to 03-02 and silently return the wrong
  day), both-ends-or-neither, `from <= to`.
- **Caching is range-aware:** a window that ended before today is immutable and caches for 6h;
  anything touching today keeps 60s. The comparison is in UTC while IDX trades in WIB (UTC+7),
  which is safe in the only direction that matters — UTC's date is never *ahead* of WIB's, so a
  live session can never be classified settled. Verified across all 24 UTC hours.

### Fixed — login capture

Four defect classes, all found on Windows 11 / Node 24 / Edge.

**Failures that looked like success**

- Closing the browser mid-login exited **`0`**. The DevTools socket was the only handle keeping the
  event loop alive and the timeout timer was `unref()`'d, so the loop drained with the capture
  promise still pending and the process exited cleanly having stored nothing.
- A token-store write failure was swallowed by a `catch` that logged at debug level, and surfaced
  ~15 minutes later as *"no session captured"* — the opposite of what happened.
- Launching against a profile another window already had open hung for the full login timeout. The
  new process hands off to the running instance and exits, so the debugging port never opens.
  Startup is now bounded separately and watches the child.

**The token could be destroyed before it was read**

`Network.getResponseBody` resolves against a target that must still exist, so a login finishing in a
popup that closes itself — the shape every OAuth provider uses — took the body with it. Capture now
intercepts at `Fetch`'s Response stage, which *pauses* the request while the body is read, with the
`Network` route kept as a fallback.

> **`armSession`'s ordering is load-bearing — do not "simplify" it.** `waitForDebuggerOnStart`
> freezes each new target, and for worker-class targets `Network.enable` is dispatched to that
> frozen thread, so its reply cannot arrive until the `Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger` an `await`
> would be blocking on. Circular: the target stays frozen for the whole login window. Every enable
> is therefore **bounded**, and the resume runs in a **`finally`**. `CDP.send` gained an optional
> timeout for the same reason — it previously had none and no rejection on session detach.

**Security**

- Browser discovery no longer shells out to `where`, which on Windows **searches the current
  directory before PATH**. A `chrome.exe` dropped in the working directory would have been launched
  as "the browser" — with a remote debugging port open, for the user to type brokerage credentials
  into. PATH is now resolved in-process with the working directory excluded.
- A browser profile that has logged in is a second copy of the credential (session cookies + Login
  Data). Profiles are created `0o700`, throwaway profiles are deleted after use, and `logout`
  removes the profile as well as the token (`--keep-profile` opts out).
- HAR parse errors no longer interpolate V8's `SyntaxError` message, which quotes the offending
  source text — that printed fragments of a file containing the user's password and cookies.

### Added — browser support, HAR import, diagnostics

- **Discovery rewritten**: `STOCKBIT_BROWSER` → Windows *App Paths* registry → `PATH` → known
  paths, deduplicated and drivable-first, across win32/darwin/linux. The previous three hard-coded
  Windows paths missed per-user Chrome under `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (the install you get without admin
  rights) and every Chromium fork. Firefox is detected and reported as **unsupported** rather than
  silently ignored — it removed CDP in v141 and speaks only WebDriver BiDi.
- **`stockbit-auth import-har`** — log in with any browser, export the DevTools network log, import
  it. This is the only route for Safari, which exposes no debugging protocol to third parties. A
  login HAR is parsed in memory, never logged, size-capped, and `--shred` deletes it after import.
- **`stockbit-auth doctor`** — preflight checklist whose self-test drives the *real* capture path
  against a local fixture serving its token from a self-closing popup. No account, credentials, or
  open market required, and `persist: false` so it cannot overwrite a stored token. Non-zero exit on
  failure. See `docs/TESTING-LOGIN.md`.
- **`stockbit-auth login --fresh-profile`** for a throwaway profile; the default is now persistent,
  so a re-login does not mean re-entering password and OTP.

### Changed — documentation

- `docs/stockbit-api.md` §4a previously documented the `period` enum as having "likely date-range
  variants". **It does not** — 16 candidates were swept and rejected, leaving only
  `BROKER_SUMMARY_PERIOD_LATEST` and `_UNSPECIFIED`. Replaced with the measured behaviour table.
- **Refresh rotation confirmed.** The README listed it as unverified. Comparing SHA-256 digests of
  the stored token across a refresh shows each one mints a **new** refresh token with a fresh 7-day
  expiry, so the single interactive login is genuinely one-time *provided the server runs at least
  weekly*.
- Recorded that **Google and Facebook login are broken on Stockbit's own website**, in any browser,
  with or without this tool: the login page loads `gapi.auth2` (the Google Sign-In platform Google
  retired) and never migrated to Google Identity Services. Verified in an ordinary browser with no
  automation involved. Use username + password; nothing in this repository can fix it.

### Testing — 48/49 → 95/95

- The pre-existing Windows failure is fixed. Two assertions in `auth.test.ts` are gated to
  non-win32: NTFS cannot express mode `0o600`, and `chmod` cannot revoke write access, so neither
  the mode check nor the unwritable-directory case is constructible there. Both remain fully
  asserted on POSIX.
- Wire-level assertions for the date range: the ranged request must carry `from`/`to` and **no**
  `period`; the no-dates request must be byte-identical to the pre-feature behaviour; aliases must
  never appear in the query string; invalid input must not reach the network.

> **A note on the wire-level tests.** An earlier revision asserted only on the exported helper that
> *builds* the params. Replacing the call site in `getBrokerSummary` with the pre-feature object
> left the entire suite green — the test named "the invariant this whole feature depends on"
> guarded a function nothing proved production called. If you add coverage here, assert the request
> that actually goes out, and check that your test fails when the feature is deleted.
